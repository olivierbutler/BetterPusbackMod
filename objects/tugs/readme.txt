Reduced Tug Sound for Betterpushback in X-Plane 12
by Tom Knudsen - post@tknudsen.com


What is it?

This is a sound fix for Betterpushback by Saso Kiselkov
https://github.com/skiselkov/BetterPushbackC/releases


This will remove/reduce sound of the pushback tug when you are inside the airplane. 
It will also reduce the sound in external view so that the tug is hearable when up close. 

There is now way to hear the ground vehicle when you are sitting in the cockpit due to the noise environment. 



How to install

Backup all your texture you intent to overwrite, good practice :) 

Move the content folders into 

\X-Plane 12\Resources\plugins\BetterPushback\objects\tugs

and overwrite any files it asks about. 


Note!!

You will not hear or hear less the pushback tug taxi to the plane, but all other communications are still there. 
You will hear the tug outside the plane. 



Enjoy!
